# Declarative UI

Jetpack Compose is a modern declarative UI Toolkit for Android.

Declarative programming allows developers to design the user interface based solely on `what` they want to be displayed without regard to `how` the device will update its state.

Oftentimes, declarative frameworks rely on an underlying imperative implementation that translates the declarative command into a set of imperative instructions for the device to complete.

In declarative approach we use only one language for UI and logic both.

# Imperative UI

Currently, the most common paradigm, imperative programming requires the developer to write step-by-step how the program will reflect the desired state or perform an operation. For UI creation, developers write detailed code that tells the device how to display the components.

`XML` approach of android UI is the example of imperative ui.
