# Basic code

As of now we have the following code:

<Image src="/img/ideal-starting-code.png" alt="jetpack compose starting code"/>

We will understand these code later. First of all we will write some basic code and will see it is working.

Put the following code at line no. 25

```kotlin
Text("Hello World")
```

Your final code should look like below:

<Image src="/img/basic-final-code.png" alt="jetpack compose starting basic code"/>

Now, run your app. You should see something like below:

<Image src="/img/basic-final-code-output.png" alt="basic jetpack compose code output"/>

<Image src="/img/congratulation.gif" alt=""/>
